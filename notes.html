                <p id="lead">Designing a new portfolio is easy. Committing your <br> time and following through with that original concept, <br> that's the tricky part.</p>
                <div class="body">
                <p>I first started working on a new draft of my portfolio in 2011. I haven't been working on this <br> update for two years, but I have been coming back to it ever few months. It's undergone <br> countless iterations.</p>
                <p>Why has it taken so long? I've been afraid to commit to any one idea. It seemed like <br> when I would decide upon a certain direction, the web would up and change <br> its game. This was more down to me taking my sweet time <br> more than anything else.</p>
                <p>Not that I'm complaining. It practically became a hobby of mine to tinker with a new <br> portfolio. In a way I'm a little sad that the sketching / prototyping / designing / coding <br> elements of the portfolio are ultimately finished, but I'm excited to add some flourishes in the <br> coming weeks and months.</p>
                <p>In the next few weeks I'm also going to write about the decisions I made while building out <br> this site - inspiration, evolution, content management, execution. Hopefully it may be of some <br> use to those starting out with building their first portfolio - maybe help shave a year or two off <br> it here and there!</p>
